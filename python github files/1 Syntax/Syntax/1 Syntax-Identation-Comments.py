•	Execute Python Syntax
	Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line.

•	Python Indentation
	Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
	Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
	Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.
	The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
	You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise, Python will give you an error.

•	Python Comments
	Python has the commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
	Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment.
